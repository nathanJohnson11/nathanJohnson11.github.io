## 3D Scene Application Refactoring<br/>CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization<br/>Software Design and Engineering Category

---

I chose a 3D graphics project from CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization. This program, built in C++ with OpenGL, renders a fully navigable three-dimensional world. It features textured objects, dynamic lighting, and realistic shading. Users can move freely through the scene, looking at objects from any angle while the lighting shifts in real time. The program uses ambient and directional lighting models, along with texture mapping, to create an immersive experience that reacts to user input.

This artifact involves proper software design and object-oriented principles. The program worked, but the code was a mess. The main file was bloated with vertex and index generators for different shapes, making it hard to follow. Global variables were scattered everywhere, making it nearly impossible to track data changes. I tackled the problem by refactoring the code and creating a proper class hierarchy. I built a base Shape class and derived classes for specific shapes like Cube, along with specialized types like Light. This restructuring pulled the vertex and index generators into their respective classes, making the code far more organized.

The implemented design creates a stronger coding environment by restructuring and modularizing the code. Each shape now has its own defined space, a class that holds not just its form but its behavior. It's now like each of the items is properly stored on shelves rather than scattered across a floor. These shapes are easier to find, maintain, and modify when they each have a designated place in the architecture. Through implementing constructors that accept size parameters, I enhanced the flexibility of shape creation in the program. The Cube class constructor now takes a cubeSize parameter that determines the dimensions of generated vertices.

Classes lock data away while global variables leave everything exposed. Security comes down to controlling who can access what. Private data stays protected, but public data can be changed by anyone. Getters and setters create safe pathways to access information. This professional approach isn't just theoretical, it's practical. The system can now handle new shapes of different sizes without major rewrites. The code also adapts to new needs without extensive modifications to the core system.

Isolation matters in software design. When shapes live in their own classes, problems stay contained within clear boundaries instead of spreading throughout the codebase. Bugs have fewer places to hide, and changes to one component hurt less because they don't ripple through the entire system. OpenGL and object design don't naturally work together. OpenGL needs state while objects need independence. Finding balance between them was the main challenge. Testing each piece after changes kept the program working correctly. Over time, messy code became organized design. The program runs better now and is easier to update.
