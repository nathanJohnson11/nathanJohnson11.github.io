## Animal Shelter Database Interface<br/>CS 340: Client/Server Development<br/>Databases Category

---

I chose a database interaction module from CS 340 called animal_shelter.py. This program, built in Python, connects to a MongoDB database and manages animal shelter data. It provides basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for adding new animal records, updating existing information, deleting records, and retrieving specific data. The original implementation used hardcoded database credentials and had minimal error handling. The program successfully connected to the database and performed basic functions but lacked security features and performance optimizations needed in a real production environment.

This artifact involves the engineering of practices of validating input data and architect and design with default denial when accessing databases records. This skill develops a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources. I improved the system by replacing hardcoded credentials with environment variables. This makes the application more secure by keeping sensitive information out of the source code. Now credentials can be managed separately for different environments.

The implemented data structure is programmatic, where the stored variable values can be used efficiently in different functions and operations. This approach improves the design and evaluation of computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices. I added comprehensive error handling with try-except blocks around database operations. The enhanced code now catches specific MongoDB exceptions and provides clear error messages. I also added logging functionality that records errors, warnings and successful operations.

Database security matters in software development. When credentials are stored as environment variables, they're protected from accidental exposure in source control. Through adding unit tests for all CRUD operations, I made the system more reliable. The tests use a separate test database to avoid affecting real data and include setup and teardown methods. I put in database indexing too. By adding indexes to frequently queried fields using MongoDB's createIndex() method, searches are much faster, especially for operations filtering on common fields like breed and location.

The enhancements I made to this artifact demonstrate my ability to develop professional database interfaces that prioritize security, reliability, and performance. Error handling proved more complex than expected. MongoDB can throw different types of exceptions, and properly catching each type required studying both Python's exception system and MongoDB's error documentation. The enhanced database module now has the security, reliability, and performance features needed for a real production environment. This project taught me how important query optimization is for database systems, and how important a skill it is for any software engineer working with data-intensive applications.
