            <p>The artifacts in my portfolio showcase my ability to refactor existing code to improve its structure, readability, and maintainability. They also demonstrate my skills in database design and management, including creating efficient schemas, writing optimized queries, and ensuring data security.</p>
            
            <h3>Security</h3>
            <p>Security is a critical aspect of modern software development. Throughout my program, I've learned to identify potential security vulnerabilities in code, implement secure coding practices, and design systems with security in mind. I understand common security threats such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and buffer overflows, and know how to mitigate these risks.</p>
            
            <p>My enhanced artifacts demonstrate my commitment to security by incorporating input validation, error handling, secure data storage, and protection against common vulnerabilities. I understand that security is not just a feature but a mindset that should be integrated throughout the development process.</p>
            
            <h3>Professional Goals and Readiness</h3>
            <p>As I complete my degree program, I am prepared to enter the software development field as a skilled professional. My technical skills in programming, algorithm design, database management, and security, combined with my soft skills in communication, collaboration, and problem-solving, make me a well-rounded candidate for software engineering positions.</p>
            
            <p>This ePortfolio demonstrates not only what I have learned but also my ability to apply that knowledge to real-world problems. The enhancement of existing code to improve its design, efficiency, and security shows my capability to contribute meaningfully to software development projects from day one.</p>
            
            <p>I am excited to continue growing as a software engineer and look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead in this dynamic and ever-evolving field.</p>

                <p>I selected this artifact for enhancement because it demonstrates my ability to work with complex graphics programming and showcases my understanding of object-oriented design principles. The original code had several limitations that provided excellent opportunities for enhancement:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The original code lacked proper object-oriented structure</li>
                    <li>There was significant code repetition and poor encapsulation</li>
                    <li>The application had limited extensibility for adding new shapes or features</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Enhancements Implemented</h4>
                <p>I implemented the following improvements to the software design:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Created a robust class hierarchy with a base Shape class and derived classes for specific shapes</li>
                    <li>Implemented proper encapsulation with private member variables and public accessor methods</li>
