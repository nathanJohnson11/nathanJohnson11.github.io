## Code Review

---

In the code review videos, I analyzed the three selected artifacts code for weaknesses, limitations, and vulnerabilities and explained my plan for enhancements. The code review is a walk-through of the existing source code and planned improvements to software design and engineering artifacts, algorithms and data structure, and databases. Through the developed videos, I continue advancing my abilities to deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communication techniques to effectively explain a code review through collaborative environments that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts. In the artifact code analysis, I demonstrate the critical elements of:

* Existing functionality: A detailed walk-through of the existing code focused on the features and function of the current code.
* Code Analysis: Target areas of improvement in structure, logic, efficiency, functionality, security, testing, commenting, and documenting.
* Enhancements: A walk-through of planned enhancements that address issues raised in the code analysis.

### Software Design and Engineering Enhancements

The artifact selected for the software design and engineering code review is the **3D Scene Application**. The application was planned, designed, and developed as part of the computer science course CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization. The program renders a 3D scene with textured objects, dynamic lighting, and camera movement controls. I developed the application in C++ using OpenGL. The enhancement planned to implement is to refactor the code using proper object-oriented design principles, creating a clear class hierarchy, and improving code organization.

### Algorithms and Data Structure Enhancements

The code review in algorithms and data structure is the artifact of the **Contact Service**. The program was planned, designed, and developed as part of the CS 320: Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance computer science course. The program aims to create a contact management system with CRUD functionality. The program is developed in the Java programming language. The enhancement planned to implement is to replace the ArrayList-based storage with a HashMap for O(1) lookup operations, optimize the update function, and improve error handling and validation.

### Databases Enhancements

The code review in databases is the artifact of **Animal Shelter Database Interface**. The program was planned, designed, and developed for the CS 340 Client-Server Development computer science course. The application aims to create a database interface that connects to MongoDB for managing animal shelter data. The application is developed in Python with the PyMongo driver. The planned enhancement is to implement environment variables for database credentials, add comprehensive error handling and logging, optimize queries with database indexes, and create a unit testing framework.
