## Professional Self-Assessment

Throughout my journey in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University, I have developed a comprehensive set of skills that have prepared me for success in the software development industry. This ePortfolio showcases my growth and expertise in key areas of computer science, including software engineering, algorithms and data structures, and database management.

My time in the Computer Science program has been one of continuous learning and improvement. Each course built upon the foundational concepts learned in previous classes, allowing me to develop a deep understanding of software development principles. Starting with basic programming concepts, I progressed through more complex topics such as object-oriented design, data structures, algorithm efficiency, database design, and software security.

The capstone course has been instrumental in bringing together everything I've learned into a cohesive portfolio that demonstrates my abilities as a software engineer. Through enhancing existing projects, I've been able to showcase my technical skills while also demonstrating my ability to collaborate, communicate effectively, and consider security in software design.

| **Technical Skills** | **Soft Skills** |
|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| C++ Programming | Problem Solving |
| Java Development | Critical Thinking |

Collaboration is essential in modern software development. Throughout my coursework, I've participated in team-based projects that mirrored real-world development environments. I've learned to use version control systems like Git effectively, communicate technical concepts clearly to both technical and non-technical team members, and provide constructive code reviews to ensure code quality.

In my professional experience, I've worked in agile development environments, participating in daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives. I understand the importance of clear communication, respect for diverse perspectives, and the need to balance individual contributions with team goals. These collaborative experiences have taught me how to be both an effective leader and a supportive team member.

Effective communication with stakeholders is crucial for project success. Throughout my academic career, I've developed the ability to translate complex technical concepts into language that non-technical stakeholders can understand. I've learned to create clear, professional documentation, deliver effective presentations, and adapt my communication style to different audiences.

## Refinement Plan and Code Review

As a software engineer, I know that code reviews are critical aspects of software development. Code reviews ensure quality assurance for our project's code and often identify critical bugs early on in its life cycle. Through reviewing the selected artifacts for software design and engineering, algorithms and data structure, and databases, I was able to identify areas for improvement and create a plan for enhancing each artifact.

In my code review videos, I analyzed the three selected artifacts code for weaknesses, limitations, and vulnerabilities and explained my plan for enhancements. The code review is a walk-through of the existing source code and planned improvements to software design and engineering artifacts, algorithms and data structure, and databases. Through these videos, I demonstrate:

* Existing functionality: A detailed walk-through of the existing code focused on the features and function of the current code.
* Code Analysis: Target areas of improvement in structure, logic, efficiency, functionality, security, testing, commenting, and documenting.
* Enhancements: A walk-through of planned enhancements that address issues raised in the code analysis.

## Software Design and Engineering

For the software design and engineering category, I chose a 3D graphics project from CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization. This program, built in C++ with OpenGL, renders a fully navigable three-dimensional world. It features textured objects, dynamic lighting, and realistic shading. Users can move freely through the scene, looking at objects from any angle while the lighting shifts in real time.

The program worked, but the code was a mess. The main file was bloated with vertex and index generators for different shapes, making it hard to follow. Global variables were scattered everywhere, making it nearly impossible to track data changes. The structure was chaotic, and making any changes was slow and frustrating. Yet, despite the clutter, the program did what it was supposed to. That made it the perfect candidate for improvement. I saw a chance to take something functional but tangled and rebuild it into something clean, logical, and well-structured.

I tackled the problem by refactoring the code and creating a proper class hierarchy. I built a base Shape class and derived classes for specific shapes like Cube, along with specialized types like Light. This restructuring pulled the vertex and index generators into their respective classes, making the code far more organized. As I worked, the solution became clear, each shape needed its own defined space, a class that held not just its form but its behavior.

## Algorithms and Data Structure

For the algorithms and data structure category, I chose a contact management system from CS 320. This program, built in Java, handles a database of contacts with core CRUD functionality. It stores personal information like names, phone numbers, and addresses. Users can add new contacts, update existing information, delete contacts, and retrieve specific records by ID.

The contact system worked, but performance was an issue. The ArrayList implementation meant every operation required scanning through the entire list, making searches slow as contact numbers grew. Updating or deleting contacts required finding the right index first, which wasn't efficient. The code worked fine with small numbers, but would struggle with larger datasets. That made it perfect for improvement. I saw a chance to take something functional but inefficient and transform it into something that could handle real-world scenarios with hundreds or thousands of contacts.

I improved the system by replacing the ArrayList with a HashMap for contact storage. Using contact IDs as keys dramatically improved lookup speed. This change reduced search, update, and delete operations from O(n) time complexity to O(1), making the system much faster. While an ArrayList needs to check every contact until it finds the right one, a HashMap jumps straight to the correct record.

## Databases

For the databases category, I chose a database interaction module from CS 340 called animal_shelter.py. This program, built in Python, connects to a MongoDB database and manages animal shelter data. It provides basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for adding new animal records, updating existing information, deleting records, and retrieving specific data.

The MongoDB connection code worked, but security was a major issue. The hardcoded credentials in the source code meant anyone with access to the file could see the database username and password. Error handling was minimal, with operations sometimes failing silently or providing unhelpful error messages. The database queries weren't optimized, which would cause problems as data volume grew. There was also no testing framework to verify the code worked properly. That made it perfect for improvement. I saw a chance to take something functional but insecure and transform it into something that could handle real-world scenarios with proper security and performance.

I improved the system by replacing hardcoded credentials with environment variables. This makes the application more secure by keeping sensitive information out of the source code. I added comprehensive error handling with try-except blocks around database operations and logging functionality that records errors, warnings and successful operations. Through adding unit tests for all CRUD operations, I made the system more reliable. I also put in database indexing to make searches much faster, especially for operations filtering on common fields like breed and location.
