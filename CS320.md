## Contact Service Optimization<br/>CS 320: Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance<br/>Algorithms and Data Structure Category

---

I chose a contact management system from CS 320. This program, built in Java, handles a database of contacts with core CRUD functionality. It stores personal information like names, phone numbers, and addresses. Users can add new contacts, update existing information, delete contacts, and retrieve specific records by ID. The original implementation used an ArrayList-based storage system that worked adequately for small datasets but would struggle with larger collections of contacts.

This artifact demonstrates algorithm and data structure optimization. The contact system worked, but performance was an issue. The ArrayList implementation meant every operation required scanning through the entire list, making searches slow as contact numbers grew. I improved the system by replacing the ArrayList with a HashMap for contact storage. Using contact IDs as keys dramatically improved lookup speed. This change reduced search, update, and delete operations from O(n) time complexity to O(1), making the system much faster. While an ArrayList needs to check every contact until it finds the right one, a HashMap jumps straight to the correct record.

The implemented optimization improves the design and evaluation of computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices. Through optimizing the update function, I made the system more efficient by only changing what's different. The old code replaced everything every time. Now it only updates what actually changed. This saves time and keeps things running smooth, especially when just changing one small detail. The Contact class already had validation in the constructor, but I improved how the service layer works with it to maintain data integrity throughout the system's operation.

Data structures matter in algorithm design. A HashMap gives immediate access without searching the entire collection. This approach isn't just theoretical, it's practical. The system can now handle larger contact databases without slowing down. The code also adapts to new requirements more easily because of its more modular design and improved error handling system. I put in better error checks too. The system tests contact IDs and other fields before accepting changes. When something's wrong, it says exactly what the problem is instead of just failing.

Performance matters in software development. When contacts are stored in a HashMap, operations stay high-speed even as the database grows. Searches don't get slower with more contacts, and updates happen immediately because the system knows exactly where to look. Time complexity and space requirements don't always align. HashMaps need more memory than arrays, but they save tremendous time. Finding this balance was the main challenge. The program handles larger datasets now and responds much faster. This project taught me how important data structure selection is for any software engineer working with data-intensive applications.
